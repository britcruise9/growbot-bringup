"""GrowBot's first hello — lights, voice, and legs together, gently.

Wakes its LED ring, says hello, and waves its legs. Every subsystem is optional:
if the LED ring, speaker, or servos aren't present, that part is skipped and the
rest still runs — so even a half-built robot says hi.

LEDs need root, so for the full effect run:

    sudo -E python3 scripts/hello_growbot.py
