# --- Servo bus (SCS0009 / SC09 Feetech serial-bus servos) ---

# exists but raises termios.error (5, 'Input/output error').

# Servo IDs present on the bus. GrowBot has two legs.

# Usable encoder range. The SCS0009 reports 0-1023 over its ~300 deg of travel,
# but the usable floor on our units is 255 — commanding below that just stalls
# at 255. Motion is clamped to this range so you can't drive into the dead zone.

# ~30 units is a few degrees: visible, gentle, nowhere near the end stops.

# --- Body mapping ---
# NOTE: which servo ID drives which leg depends on YOUR horn mounting, so this
# kit never assumes a side — it tests servos by ID and nudges around each
# joint's current position. Record your own mapping here once you've confirmed
# it, e.g. LEFT_LEG_ID = 2 / RIGHT_LEG_ID = 1.
