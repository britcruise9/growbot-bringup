"""Minimal driver for a WS2812 / NeoPixel LED ring via rpi_ws281x.

GrowBot's ring is 7 pixels on GPIO12 (PWM0). The WS2812 timing is generated
by the Pi's PWM + DMA, which requires **root** — run scripts that use this with
`sudo`. If rpi_ws281x is missing or you're not root, construction raises a clear
error so callers can skip lights gracefully.
